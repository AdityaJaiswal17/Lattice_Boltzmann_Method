Boundary conditions:
Bottom, Left & Right wall - No slip boundary condition
Top wall - Moving wall condition

Top wall velocity = 0.1 (simulation value)
Reynolds number is set to 100.

Validation of computational results with experimental literature (Ghia et al 1982) is also given.
NOTE: for validation, the output values should be non-dimensionalized (example - velocity/0.1 & x/100 or y/100) and then compared.

The output file is created and:
1st & 2nd column - x and y values
3rd & 4th column - x & y velocities
5th column - velocity resultant magnitude
6th column - density
