D2Q9 Lattice - BGK model.

Boundary conditions:
Top & Bottom Wall - No slip boundary conditions
Left & Right wall - periodic boundary

gravity is applied in x direction with a simulation value of 1.25*1e-5 in order to keep the Reynolds number = 100 and maximum velocity = 0.1.

The Guo et al forcing scheme is used "Z. Guo, C. Zheng, B. Shi, Phys. Rev. E 65, 46308 (2002)".
