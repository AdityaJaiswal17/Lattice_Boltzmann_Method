D1Q3 Lattice BGK Model

Boundary conditions are set to periodic conditions, with initial conditions at Temperature = 100 @ both ends and Temperature = 1000 @ midpoint.

To run the program just compile it and run;
g++ 1D_heat_diff.cpp; ./a.out

An output folder will be created with the first column giving the domain points and the second column will give the temperature distribution.
